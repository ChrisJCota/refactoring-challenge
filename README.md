# refactoring-challenge


## Description

Motivation: Motivation for this assignment was because there were not enough semantic HTML Elements, there was no creative title, and the format of the HTML code was structured poorly.
Why was the project built: This project was built in order to identify where sections might need more semantic elements, practice using identifiers on those elements, how to build better structure to HTML code to make it more readable, & importance of giving a project a creative title.
What Problem does this solve: This challenge solves the problem of having difficult to read HTML code due to lack of structure and semantic HTML elements, as well as a vague title.
What did I learn: I learned how to identify poor structure to HTML code, and how to fix it with adding more identifiers, spacing and semantic HTML elements.

## Usage

This project should be used as an example of how to build strong HTML stucture so the code is easily readable and accessible through semantic html elements and element identfiers.
